# Installation Guide

## Setting up a Python Environment

1. **Install Python 3.10**: Ensure that Python 3.10.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's directory. Then, create a virtual environment by running:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the name you wish to give to your virtual environment.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**, run:
     ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Unix or MacOS**, run:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

## Installing Dependencies

After activating your virtual environment, install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is in the same directory as where you're running the command, or provide the path to it.

## Using the Environment

With the virtual environment activated and the dependencies installed, you're now ready to run your Python project. Remember to activate the virtual environment each time you work on the project by following the activation steps above.
